## upscaled skin
\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\player\wide\kai.png 
is relaced with an upscaled to a 32x version of my skin.
When the file containing your skin in the asset\skins folder cannot be read this is used as a fallback. (ONLY FOR ME AS MY DEFAULT SKIN IS KAI)
This can be forced by finding the folder containing the skin and renaming a empty txt file to replace the skin.

## TO DO:
potentially use minecraft's internal shaders to automatically upscale skins to 128x128. There have been packs that did this but as the upscaling is done with an algorithm the quality sucks.

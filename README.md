| Texture or Feature                          | Change Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Ingots**                              | All metal ingots (iron, gold, copper, etc.) have unique, recognizable shapes.         |
|  **Dyes**                                 | Every dye now has a distinct shapeâ€”not just colorâ€”for better inventory readability.   |
|  **Redstone, Glowstone, Gunpowder, Sugar** | These particle items are now uniquely shaped, helping differentiate them at a glance. |
|  **Redstone Dust Lines**                  | Pixel gaps in redstone line textures have been cleaned up for smoother appearance.    |
|  **Main Menu Background**                 | Dirt-themed background replaces the default panorama for a cozy, grounded look.       |
|  **Entity Shadows**                       | Shadows under mobs and players are clearer and more defined for better visibility.    |
|  **Upscaled Skin**                       | currently only upscales my own minecraft skin using a workaround on the kai skin.    |
